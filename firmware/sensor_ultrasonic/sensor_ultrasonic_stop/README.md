# PARTS Common Robot Platform

## Introduction
The Portland Area Robotics Society's Common Robotics Platform is a comprehensive project integrating SBUS communication for remote control and ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection. It is primarily designed for Arduino-based robots, offering an accessible yet powerful platform for both beginners and advanced users in robotics.

## Features
- SBUS communication for remote controlling robots.
- Ultrasonic sensor integration for obstacle detection.
- Motor control based on SBUS inputs and sensor data.
- Easy to understand and modify for custom projects.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE
- Ultrasonic sensor library
- SBUS library

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/parts-common-robot-platform.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Arduino IDE.
3. Install the required libraries through the Arduino Library Manager.

## Usage
Load the provided sketch onto your Arduino board connected to the appropriate SBUS receiver and ultrasonic sensor. The sketch will enable your robot to respond to SBUS remote control commands while avoiding obstacles using the ultrasonic sensor.
